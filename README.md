ZeroBin 0.3 Alpha

This is a fork of ZeroBin by Sebastien Sauvage (sebsauvage.net). This
fork has driffed from the original project and is now based on the
Twig template engine and Twitter Bootstrap.

ZeroBin is a minimalist, opensource online pastebin where the server
has zero knowledge of pasted data. Data is encrypted/decrypted in the
browser using the sjcl JavaScript Library (http://crypto.stanford.edu/sjcl/).
